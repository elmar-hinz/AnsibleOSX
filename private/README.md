# Dummy role for roles/private

This is just a placeholder directory to give Ansible something to find
for the role `private`.

Please customize YOUR private role in `roles/private` which will take
precedence as soon as it is created. 

The directory `roles/private` is set in .gitignore to keep your 
role out of the public repo.

It may be a good idea to symlink `roles/private` to a directory 
you share with your other machines like into a cloud drive.
